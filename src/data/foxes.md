title: Fox Enclosure
---

Right at the top end of the property is the new fox enclosure, which is also currently under construction.
The enclosure is of a similar construction to the enclosures, a large metal-mesh building, but is longer than the other enclosures.
Attached to the side of the enclosure at one end is a wooden house for the foxes to sleep in, and a dome-shaped port-hole window for the foxes to look out from.
