title: Donation Trees
---

Attached to the back of [The Studio](#the-studio), you can find the "leafer" donation trees.
These flat trees are comprised of metal leaves, each engraved with the name of someone who donated $100 or more during the initial Alveus fundraising stream.

The supporters listed here are commonly referred to as "leafers", due to the leaves on these trees recognising their donations.
