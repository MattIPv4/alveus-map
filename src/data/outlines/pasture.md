The pasture is a large expanse of dirt, grass and trees located near the entrance of the property.
At the top end of pasture is the barn, where food for the animals in the pasture is kept, as well as a stall for Winnie and an open stall used to feed some of the animals.
There is a vehicle gate on the left side of the pasture at the top end, and a smaller gate near the barn.
