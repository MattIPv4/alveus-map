title: Chicken Coop
---

The chickens have a large wooden coop with multiple nesting boxes, and an even larger run with mesh siding and shade cloth.
The coop is located right next to the parrot aviary, just off the entrance road opposite the pasture.

Here you'll find:
- Oliver _(Olive Egger Chicken)_
- Nugget _(Ameraucana Chicken)_
